**STOCK MARKET PREDICTION AND FFORECASTING USING STALKED LSTM**(Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of neural network architecture that is commonly used for time series prediction tasks, including stock market forecasting.  

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
This project aims to predict and forecast stock market prices using a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Stacked LSTM is a powerful architecture for capturing temporal patterns in time series data, making it suitable for stock price prediction tasks.
