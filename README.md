**STOCK MARKET PREDICTION AND FFORECASTING USING STALKED LSTM**(Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of neural network architecture that is commonly used for time series prediction tasks, including stock market forecasting.  


## Project Overview
This project aims to predict and forecast stock market prices using a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Stacked LSTM is a powerful architecture for capturing temporal patterns in time series data, making it suitable for stock price prediction tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Python (version X.X.X)
- TensorFlow (version X.X.X) or any other compatible deep learning library
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. Obtain historical stock price data for the target stock(s). Data sources could include APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance), financial data providers, or self-collected data.
2. Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
3. Normalize the data to ensure that all features are on a similar scale. Scaling can be done using Min-Max scaling or Standardization.

## Model Architecture
The stacked LSTM architecture involves using multiple LSTM layers stacked on top of each other. The choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of LSTM layers and hidden units, can affect the model's performance.

## Training
1. Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Common splits are 70-80% for training, 10-15% for validation, and the remaining for testing.
2. Build and compile the stacked LSTM model using a deep learning library like TensorFlow.
3. Train the model using the training data. Monitor performance on the validation set and use techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation
1. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or others relevant to your use case.
2. Visualize the predicted prices alongside the actual stock prices to assess the model's accuracy.

## Forecasting
1. Once the model is trained and validated, use it to make future predictions.
2. Feed the most recent historical data into the model to generate predictions for the next time step.
3. Use the predicted value as input for the next time step, and repeat this process iteratively to generate a forecast.
